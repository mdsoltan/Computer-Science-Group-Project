Group project for Intro to Comp Sci


*****NOTICE*****
The *Final Project* folder has all the necessary files for our final product. 

Since we developed on different machines, we could not include any IDE specific files.

Thus, in order to actually run our final product, please put all the items from the *FINAL PRODUCT* folder into the proper directories for your IDE.

Our apologies for any inconvenience this may cause. 

Thank you for your time.
